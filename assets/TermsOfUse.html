2. HOW THE APP USES INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU:

A. Service Provider uses personally identifying information you supply through the App to provide you with the service you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to send you the publication. Similarly, if you enter an online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.

B. Unless otherwise specified on the App, Service Provider may sell or share personally identifying information with our affiliates and with carefully selected companies who we think can offer you services and products of interest to you. If you do not wish to have your personally identifying information shared, write to us at the street address set forth at the end of this document. If you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by e-mail, simply follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the e-mail. If you’ve registered on any part of the App, please use the mechanism on the App that allows you to change or update your member preferences or information, if available, to keep all such date accurate and up-to-date. Otherwise, contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator as described below with your changes.

C. We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. And if you choose to purchase items through features on the App, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us on or through parts of the App that may be managed or participated in by third parties, such as shopping areas. In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties.

D. We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.

E. In addition, we reserve the right to use the information we collect about your mobile or other device (including its location), which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer the App. Location information about your device may specifically be used to show you content and sponsored messaging based on location when and where that feature is available.

F. While your personally identifying information is protected as outlined above, we reserve the right to use, transfer, sell, and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

G. In addition, as our business changes, we may buy or sell various assets. In the event all or a portion of the assets owned or controlled by Service Provider, its parent or any subsidiary or affiliated entity are sold, assigned, transferred or acquired by another company, the information from and/or about our App users may be among the transferred assets.

Local Device Storage may also involve your personally identifiable information.

B. Some of our advertisers may also use Local Device Storage or similar technologies in connection with your mobile or other device and, if so, Service Provider bears no responsibility or liability in connection therewith.

C. We may also use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the App. These vendors may use Local Device Storage or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data including for example the make and model of the mobile or other device you are using, and (if applicable) your location, the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, IP address, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of Local Device Storage or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith.
